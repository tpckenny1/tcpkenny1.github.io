The sb-admin Jekyll theme is maintained at [vsoch/sb-admin-jekyll](https://www.github.com/vsoch/sb-admin-jekyll)
and is a Jekyll-ized port of the Startbootstrap [sb-admin-2](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/sb-admin-2/).

### How is it changed?

The primary change is that the "dashboard" layout is converted into what is typical for jekyll,
showing a feed of content (posts) that are paginated. The elements are included as pages
under a collection called "docs," and the different chart types are rendered as includes
with data from the _data folder.

This theme is under development, and is not ready for use.
